For cd, if you are to input it with no arguments, then the directory changes back to the root directory /home.
Using cd to go into directories such as lecture1 and messages worked fine, but when trying to go into a file it would not allow it and result in error
Also even when multiple directories deep such as /home/lecture1/messages, doing cd will reset it to root direc3tory /home


# ls
